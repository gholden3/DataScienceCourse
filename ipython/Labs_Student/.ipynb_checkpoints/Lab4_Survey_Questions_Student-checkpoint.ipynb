    "What are some observations you might have about the above results? Are there any with large deviances that are not statistically significant at at least a 95% level? Is there any issue with using 95% as our threshold for statistical significance? In fact there is. We are running multiple hypothesis tests at once, and doing this is known to increase the probability that we have at least one false positive (i.e., $P(False Positive) = 1 - .95^{Ntests}$). We can apply a simplye but conservative method called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Bonferoni Correction</a>, which says that if we normally would care about an alpha level of $\\alpha$ for significance testing, and we're doing $N$ tests, then our new significance level should be $\\alpha/N$. This correction is conservative because it assumes that each test is independent. Since each group is repeatedly sampled across pairs, we know that our individual tests are not indeed independent. Nonetheless, we'll see how the results hold under this new regime. \n",
